<h3>Your Consent is Important to Us</h3>
<p>
  It is important to us that we collect, use or disclose your personal

  sensitivity of the personal information, your consent may be implied,
  deemed (using an opt-out mechanism) or express. Express consent can be
  given orally, electronically or in writing. Implied consent is consent
  that can reasonably be inferred from your action or inaction. For example,

  purposes identified to you at the relevant time.
</p>
<p>
  Typically, we will seek your consent at the time that we collect your
  personal information. In certain circumstances, your consent may be
  obtained after collection but prior to our use or disclosure of your
  personal information. If we plan to use or disclose your personal
  information for a purpose not previously identified (either in this
  Privacy Policy or separately), we will endeavor to advise you of that
  purpose before such use or disclosure.

  with respect to such withdrawal or variation of consent should be in
  writing and addressed to our Privacy Officer.If you withdraw or vary your
  consent, we may not be able to provide you with the services you request.

  we will not be able to fulfil your request.
